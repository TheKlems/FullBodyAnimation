# FullBodyAnimation

# Useful informations
I used the free software MakeHuman to generate differents human bodies. 
I export this bodies in DAE files in order to modify them and rig them properly with Blender. 
I have to rig the bodies in order to match all the joints that Kinect uses in order to track the movement of the bodies.

The Majority of my code is inspired by one of my repositories : https://github.com/TheKlems/Kinect-Avatar-Unity

## Goal
This project will help me for the IMPACT project. I am currently currently working on a re-educative system for amputees in order to create intuitive interfaces for therapists and improve the dynamics of generated body parts in virtual and augmented reality. This project may ease phantom pain for the amputees.
